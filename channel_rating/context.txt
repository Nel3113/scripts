The company is an ISP that, in addition to internet service, provides IPTV service by installing decoders (STB's) in customers' homes. These STB's are connected to the ONT's (optic fiber network) or modems (ADSL, copper network) via network cables.

In addition, the company has its own television signal, with 2 own tv shows that are broadcast from Monday to Friday at different times each during these days.

This script named "rating_kaons.py" solves the problem of calculating the rating of these programs (how many people aprox. see these shows) by generating Telnet (several at parallel) connections to each STB and checking in its configuration which channel is tuned. The query is made every 5 minutes throughout the duration of the tv shows and then an average is calculated.

As the programs are broadcast at different times repeated, the averages of viewers of the different broadcasts are also added.

The rating is calculated based on the total number of STBs in existence. One rating point (1) is 1% of the total number of STBs in the entire network (target).

The data of every execution is saved on a sqlite3 database file (not only for the company tv signal, but the rest too. The iptv service has almost 300 tv channels).

Finally, every morning, another script ("datos_por_correo.py") reads the database and extracts the numbers that are automatically sent by email to certain interested parties.

The total pool of STBs consulted is 6,000 and the execution time is approximately 3 minutes (it can be reduced further depending on the number of processors on the servers where it runs).
